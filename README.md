**Momentum** is an analog of the [Chrome Web Store app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=ru).
The application has a clock, image slider, weather widgets, audio player, and a quote of the day block. Background images and greeting changes depending on the time of day. Local storage is used to store the username and locality.
